## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

`Politely.`

Tell them where to go `("You can go to ...!": I bet the template author didn't mean to sound so aggressive)`, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability `(you are instructing me to tell them how often they should have an expectation, but you probably mean that I should set their expectations about the frequency of updates)`, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined `(declined? "That's not a vulnerability: it's a limited-time enhancement.")`, etc. 

## For immediate release

GitHub suggested I write something here, therefore, I remind you that I am against security vulnerabilities, I have always been against security vulnerabilities, and I will 
continue to fight the menace of security vulnerabilities even though it makes me unpopular with my detractors. You know what they say, "Detractors gunna tractor."
