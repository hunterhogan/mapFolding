"""
Map folding enumeration and counting algorithms with advanced optimization capabilities.

This package implements algorithms to count and enumerate the distinct ways a rectangular map can be folded, based on
the mathematical problem described in Lunnon's 1971 paper. It provides multiple layers of functionality, from high-level
user interfaces to sophisticated algorithmic optimizations and code transformation tools.

Core modules:
- basecamp: Public API with simplified interfaces for end users
- theDao: Core computational algorithm using a functional state-transformation approach
- beDRY: Core utility functions implementing consistent data handling, validation, and resource management across the
	package's computational assembly-line
- theSSOT: Single Source of Truth for configuration, types, and state management
- toolboxFilesystem: Cross-platform file management services for storing and retrieving computation results with robust
	error handling and fallback mechanisms
- oeis: Interface to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for known results

Extended functionality:
- someAssemblyRequired: Code transformation framework that optimizes the core algorithm through AST manipulation,
	dataclass transformation, and compilation techniques
	- The system converts readable code into high-performance implementations through a systematic analysis and
		transformation assembly line
	- Provides tools to "shatter" complex dataclasses into primitive components, enabling compatibility with Numba and
		other optimization frameworks
	- Creates specialized implementations tailored for specific input parameters

Testing and extension:
- tests: Comprehensive test suite designed for both verification and extension
	- Provides fixtures and utilities that simplify testing of custom implementations
	- Enables users to validate their own recipes and job configurations with minimal code
	- Offers standardized testing patterns that maintain consistency across the codebase
	- See tests/__init__.py for detailed documentation on extending the test suite

Special directories:
- .cache/: Stores cached data from external sources like OEIS to improve performance
- syntheticModules/: Contains dynamically generated, optimized implementations of the core algorithm created by the code
transformation framework
- reference/: Historical implementations and educational resources for algorithm exploration
	- reference/jobsCompleted/: Contains successful computations for previously unknown values, including first-ever
		calculations for 2x19 and 2x20 maps (OEIS A001415)

This package balances algorithm readability and understandability with high-performance computation capabilities,
allowing users to compute map folding totals for larger dimensions than previously feasible while also providing a
foundation for exploring advanced code transformation techniques.
