Eight forbidden inequalities of matching parity k and r *à la* Koehler (1968), indices of:
	[k < r < k+1 < r+1] [r < k+1 < r+1 < k] [k+1 < r+1 < k < r] [r+1 < k < r < k+1]
	[r < k < r+1 < k+1] [k < r+1 < k+1 < r] [r+1 < k+1 < r < k] [k+1 < r < k < r+1]

Four forbidden inequalities of matching parity k and r *à la* Legendre (2014), indices of:
	[k < r < k+1 < r+1] [k+1 < r+1 < k < r] [r+1 < k < r < k+1] [k < r+1 < k+1 < r]

	"""Validate.

	Mathematical reasons for the design of this function
	----------------------------------------------------

	1. To confirm that a multidimensional folding is valid, confirm that each of the constituent one-dimensional¹ foldings is valid.
	2. To confirm that a one-dimensional folding is valid, check that all creases that might cross do not cross.

	A "crease" is a convenient lie: it is a shorthand description of two leaves that are physically connected to each other.
	Leaves in a one-dimensional folding are physically connected to at most two other leaves: the prior leaf and the next leaf.
	When talking about a one-dimensional section of a multidimensional folding, we ignore the other dimension and still
	reference the prior and next leaves. To check whether two creases cross, we must compare the four leaves of the two creases.

	¹ A so-called one-dimensional folding, map, or strip of stamps has two dimensions, but one of the dimensions has a width of 1.

	Idiosyncratic reasons for the design of this function
	-----------------------------------------------------

	I name the first leaf of the first crease `leaf`. I name the leaf to which I am comparing it `comparand`. A crease² is a leaf
	and the next leaf, therefore, the crease of `leaf` connects it to `leafNextCrease`, and the crease of `comparand` connects it
	to `comparandNextCrease`. Nearly everyone else uses letters for names, such as k, k+1, r, and r+1. (Which stand for Kahlo and
	Rivera, of course.)

	² "increase" from Latin *in-* "in" + *crescere* "to grow" (from PIE root ⋆ker- "to grow"). https://www.etymonline.com/word/increase

	Computational reasons for the design of this function
	-----------------------------------------------------

	If `leaf` and `comparand` do not have matching parity in the dimension, then their creases cannot cross. To call this
	function, you need `leaf` and `comparand`, and because determining parity-by-dimension is easiest when you first select `leaf`
	and `comparand`, this function will not check the parity of `leaf` and `comparand`.

	Computing the next leaf is not expensive, but 100,000,000 unnecessary but cheap computations is expensive. Therefore, instead of
	passing `leafNextCrease` and `comparandNextCrease`, pass the functions by which those values may be computed on demand.

	Finally, we need to compare the relative positions of the leaves, so pass a function that returns the position of the "next" leaf.
