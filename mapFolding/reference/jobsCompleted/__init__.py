A version of the algorithm tuned to compute a 2x19 map took approximately 28 hours of computation,
BUT the time stamps strongly suggest that I overwrote "p2x19.py". I do not recall if the version
from 2/12/2025 differs from the version from 1/21/2025. Hypothetically, one could reproduce a version
similar to the 1/21/2025 version by restoring the state of the repository to approximately that date.
