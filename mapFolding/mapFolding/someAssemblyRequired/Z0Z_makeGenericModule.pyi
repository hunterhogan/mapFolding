\t- not jitted
\t- use the function to call a jitted function or another function that cannot receive `ComputationState` as a parameter.

\tVERY IMPORTANT: reusable code, use ifThis, Then, NodeReplacer. `shatter_dataclassesDOTdataclass`, for example, does a ton of work, but essentially every statement is a
\tmethod in one of those three classes.
