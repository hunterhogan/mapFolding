"""You can use this module to share elimination-algorithm utilities that avoid `EliminationState` imports.

This module is a workbench utility layer for `mapFolding._e` algorithms. The module primarily contains utilities that are intended
to work beyond the $2^n$-dimensional special case.

You should avoid putting functions in this module that only work on $2^n$-dimensional maps. You cannot import `EliminationState`
into this module without causing circular import problems. This constraint exists as of 2026-01-26.

	When `leafOptions` is a `LeafOptions`, `leafOptions` contains one sentinel bit that indicates the value is a `LeafOptions`.
	This function interprets the total set-bit count as a compact encoding of domain cardinality.

	- When `leafOptions.bit_count() == 1`, `leafOptions` is an empty domain. The only set bit is the sentinel bit, so the function returns `None`.

	"""Compute the bitwise AND of two `LeafOptions` with curry-friendly parameter order.

	You can use this function to mask `leafOptions` with `leafOptionsDISPOSABLE` [1]. The
	function performs bitwise AND and returns the intersection of the two leaf sets. The
	parameter order is reversed from typical AND operations to support currying [2]: you can
	partially apply `leafOptionsDISPOSABLE` to create a reusable masking function.

	Parameters
	----------
	leafOptionsDISPOSABLE : LeafOptions
		Bitset mask applied to `leafOptions`. This parameter is the first parameter to enable
		currying: you can fix `leafOptionsDISPOSABLE` and reuse the resulting function.
	leafOptions : LeafOptions
		Bitset to be masked by `leafOptionsDISPOSABLE`.

	Returns
	-------
	maskedLeafOptions : LeafOptions
		Bitwise AND of `leafOptions` and `leafOptionsDISPOSABLE`.

	Examples
	--------
	The function is used with `leafOptionsLeafNone` to normalize masked domains.

		if (ImaLeafSpaceNotAWalrusSubscript := leafOptionsLeafNone(leafOptionsAND(antiLeafOptions, leafOptions))) is None:

	The function is used to mask pile domains during constraint propagation.

		leafSpace: LeafSpace | None = leafOptionsLeafNone(leafOptionsAND(leafAntiOptions, leafOptions))

	Important
	---------
	The parameter order is reversed from typical bitwise AND operations. The first parameter
	`leafOptionsDISPOSABLE` is the mask, and the second parameter `leafOptions` is the value
	being masked. This order facilitates currying.

	"""Compute prefix sums of reversed dimension products for head-first coordinate arithmetic.

	You can use this function to obtain a tuple of cumulative sums computed from reversed
	dimension products. This tuple is useful when you are using integers as proxies for
	Cartesian coordinates in multidimensional space [1] and you need to compute offsets
	from the "anti-origin" (the maximum coordinate) rather than from the origin.

	The function reverses the first `dimensionFrom首` dimension products from `productsOfDimensions`,
	then computes prefix sums [2] of the reversed products. This provides a complementary
	perspective to `getSumsOfProductsOfDimensions` [3] by ordering dimension products in
	descending order before summation.

	Parameters
	----------
	productsOfDimensions : tuple[int, ...]
		Prefix products of dimension lengths, typically from `getProductsOfDimensions` [4].
	dimensionsTotal : int | None = None
		Total number of dimensions in the map. When `None`, inferred as
		`len(productsOfDimensions) - 1`.
	dimensionFrom首 : int | None = None
		Dimension index defining which products to include in the sum computation. When `None`,
		defaults to `dimensionsTotal`. This parameter controls how many dimension products are
		reversed and summed.

	Returns
	-------
	sumsOfProductsOfDimensionsNearest首 : tuple[int, ...]
		Tuple of prefix sums computed from reversed dimension products. Element `[i]` contains
		the sum of the first `i` elements of the reversed product sequence.

	Examples
	--------
	The function is used during state initialization to compute head-first sums.

		self.sumsOfProductsOfDimensionsNearest首 = getSumsOfProductsOfDimensionsNearest首(self.productsOfDimensions, self.dimensionsTotal, self.dimensionsTotal)
