## More ty, less Pylance

I don't understand the boundaries of the different roles, which I think are 1) language server and 2) type checker.

## A Python formatter that formats my style

There seem to be some tools for creating formats that aren't "Black" or "PEP 8", but they all seem to be a huge pain in the ass.

## An easier way to type CJK

I use code snippets to enter ideograms, which is limiting and annoying. I haven't been able to get alt-codes to work.

## Simple sorting of functions

I can easily sort lines. But I want a fast way to alpha sort functions.

## Ruff

In general, I love it. But I need to have different "levels" of strictness for different files. When I am developing a file or
function, I don't want diagnostics about commented out code or print or a bunch of other things.

## Tools to integrate or consider using

- grepWin UI
- grepWin CLI?
