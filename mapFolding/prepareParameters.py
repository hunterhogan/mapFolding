    If my parse-point wild-ass speculation is true, perhaps generalize the calculation to k-degrees, 
    then pass k as a parameter.

    Or, if the entire problem can be reliably divided into the exact number of divisions, then
    the first step should be to devolve the problem into the divisions. Second, use simplier 
    logic to count the foldings in a division. Third, sum the results of the divisions. Therefore,
    it's nearly certain that we don't know how to reliably calculate the number of divisions.

    But, is it possible to: calculate the 1st degree of divisions. Then each time the worker arrives at the 
    parse point, the worker stops, divides their current tree into one more degree of divisions, and
    "records" the entry point to those divisions for other workers to parse.
