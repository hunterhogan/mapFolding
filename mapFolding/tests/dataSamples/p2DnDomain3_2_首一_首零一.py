"""Verification data for combined leaf domains.

This module contains empirically extracted combined domain data for leaves
['3', '2', '首一', '首零一'] across multiple mapShape configurations.

Each list is named `listDomain2D{dimensionsTotal}` where `dimensionsTotal`
is the exponent in the 2^dimensionsTotal mapShape, and it contains tuples representing
valid pile positions for the specified leaves. The tuple order follows the original
leaf argument order.
