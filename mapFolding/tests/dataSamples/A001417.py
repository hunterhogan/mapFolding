"""Test data for elimination algorithm functions, indexed by n-cube dimension (2^n leavesTotal).

The OEIS sequence A001417 counts the number of ways to fold a 2^n map (n-dimensional hypercube with
side length 2 in each dimension). This module provides known test data for functions that compute
properties of such foldings, organized by `mapShape`.

Data Structure
--------------
Each dictionary is keyed by `mapShape` (a tuple defining the n-dimensional hypercube). The naming
convention `2dN` refers to a shape of `(2,) * N`, which yields `2^N` leaves. For example:
- `2d4` means `(2, 2, 2, 2)` → 16 leavesTotal
- `2d5` means `(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)` → 32 leavesTotal
- `2d6` means `(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)` → 64 leavesTotal

Synonyms:
- n=4: (2,)*4, 2d4, 16 leavesTotal, A001417(4)
- n=5: (2,)*5, 2d5, 32 leavesTotal, A001417(5)
- n=6: (2,)*6, 2d6, 64 leavesTotal, A001417(6)

Future Extensions
-----------------
When adding test data for new `mapShape`, follow these guidelines:
1. Add the new `mapShape` as a key in the appropriate dictionary
2. Use prime or Fibonacci indices for spot-checking when full data is unavailable
3. Maintain the same data format as existing entries
