# Algorithm(s) for counting distinct ways to fold a map (or a strip of stamps)

`mapFolding.countFolds()` will accept arbitrary values for the list of dimensions.

The directory `mapFolding/citations` has BibTex-formatted citations to other resources, and `mapFolding/benchmarks` has incompetent code for measuring the speed of a function. The directory `mapFolding/reference` has a verbatim transcription of the "procedure" published by _The Computer Journal_, referential versions of the procedure with explanatory comments, and some miscellaneous notes. In `mapFolding/reference/hunterNumba.py`, you will find a baseline, one-size-fits-all, self-contained, reasonably fast, contemporary algorithm but afflicted by noobaceae ignorancium.

## Connections to "Multi-dimensional map-folding" by W. F. Lunnon

### The typo-laden algorithm published in 1971

The full paper, W. F. Lunnon, Multi-dimensional map-folding, _The Computer Journal_, Volume 14, Issue 1, 1971, Pages 75â€“80, [https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/14.1.75](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/14.1.75) ([BibTex](mapFolding/citations/Lunnon.bibtex) citation) is available at the DOI link. (As of 3 January 2025, the paper is a PDF of images, not text, and can be accessed without cost or login.)

In [`foldings.txt`](mapFolding/reference/foldings.txt), you can find a text transcription of the algorithm as it was printed in 1971. In [`foldings.AA`](mapFolding/reference/foldings.AA), I have corrected obvious transcription errors, documented with comments, and I have reformatted line breaks and indentation. For contemporary readers, the result is likely easier to read than the text transcription or the original paper are easy to read. This is especially true if you view the document with semantic highlighting, such as with [Algol 60 syntax highlighter](https://github.com/PolariTOON/language-algol60).

### Java implementation(s) and improvements

[archmageirvine](https://github.com/archmageirvine/joeis/blob/80e3e844b11f149704acbab520bc3a3a25ac34ff/src/irvine/oeis/a001/A001415.java) ([BibTex](mapFolding/citations/jOEIS.bibtex) citation) says about the Java code:

```java
/**
 * A001415 Number of ways of folding a 2 X n strip of stamps.
 * @author Fred Lunnon (ALGOL68, C versions)
 * @author Sean A. Irvine (Java port)
 */
...
  // Implements algorithm as described in "Multi-dimensional map-folding",
  // by W. F. Lunnon, The Computer J, 14, 1, pp. 75--80.  Note the original
  // paper contains a few omissions, so this actual code is based on a C
  // implementation by Fred Lunnon.
```

## Connections to _The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences_ (OEIS)

For some OEIS sequences, use `mapFolding.oeisSequence_aOFn()` to calculate a(n). To get the most up-to-date list of OEIS ids to use with `oeisSequence_aOFn()`, you can use `mapFolding.getOEISids()`. For example, after installing the mapFolding package:

```cmd
(mapFolding) C:\apps\mapFolding>getOEISids

Available OEIS sequences:
  A001415: Number of ways of folding a 2 X n strip of stamps.
  A001416: Number of ways of folding a 3 X n strip of stamps.
  A001417: Number of ways of folding a 2 X 2 X ... X 2 n-dimensional map.
  A195646: Number of ways of folding a 3 X 3 X ... X 3 n-dimensional map.
  A001418: Number of ways of folding an n X n sheet of stamps.

Usage example:
  from mapFolding import oeisSequence_aOFn
  foldingsTotal = oeisSequence_aOFn('A001415', 5)
```

### "Advanced" and likely unnecessary feature: clear mapFolding's cache of OEIS data

You can clear _The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences_ data from the `mapFolding` cache. For example:

```sh
(mapFolding) C:\apps\mapFolding>clearOEIScache
Cache cleared from C:\apps\mapFolding\mapFolding\.cache
```

~~This caused my neurosis:~~ I enjoyed the following video, which is what introduced me to map folding.
